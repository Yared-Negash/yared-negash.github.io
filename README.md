My attempt at making a personal website that showcases my Software Engineering talents. HTML, jQuery, and a CSS framework called Materialize (based on Google's Material Design) were used to develop this site. Hosted via Github Pages, and is located at: [yared-negash.github.io](https://yared-negash.github.io)
